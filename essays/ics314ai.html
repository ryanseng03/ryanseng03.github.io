<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>With the boom of AI, it seems like it is everywhere now. I see it so often in various products such as photo editing, document writing and music streaming platforms. We really cannot escape it. It now plays a vital role in our technological lives. There are many instances where AI can directly write code for you. Therefore, software engineers can make their lives easier when they are stuck on a problem and can ask an AI program to do the work. Surprisingly, it does it very well. So much so that tech companies such as Github and Microsoft have employed AI in their own programs and give those tools to users in order to write code using AI. However, the issue is, will this impact University studentsâ€™ education in any way as AI is able to do many different tasks for them? Will they still get the same quality education as students prior?</p>

<h2 id="personal-experience-with-ai">Personal Experience with AI</h2>
<p>Throughout my university career, I have not used AI in too many cases. I tend to want to push through and do it on my own for dignity purposes. I get some sort of satisfaction from creating a program that solves a problem, especially when it is a difficult one that takes a lot of time and effort. Therefore, the only use cases of AI for me is a mundane task such as a short forum post or a small essay that I do not fully understand.</p>

<p>In ICS 314 (Software Engineering I), we are allowed to use AI in our assignments, and while I have reached to use it in some occasions, I do not know how to properly ask a good enough question for it to be effective. The problems that we must solve seem to be too complex for a simple query in the message box of an AI program.</p>

<h3 id="experience-wods">Experience WODs</h3>
<p>In Experience WODs, I actually enjoy doing them on my own and do not have much trouble figuring out the solution. In addition, the answers or help are given at the bottom of the experiences usually and the instructions are simple enough to follow along.</p>

<h3 id="in-class-practice-wods">In-class Practice WODs</h3>
<p>The in-class Practice WODs sometimes call for the use of AI if we are completely stuck on an issue, however I still refrained from using it as I knew I can do a simple web search and possibly find something I am looking for. This way, I am still able to learn the concept as people in forums explain what some code does and walks us through it.</p>

<h3 id="in-class-wods">In-class WODs</h3>
<p>The in-class WODs are another story. I have had some trouble with underscore functions as I usually do not know what to use in order to solve a problem or how to use it at all. I have attempted to put the prompt in the AI tool, ChatGPT, to no avail. I believe my question and wording was not effective enough to get a good response, and I just gave up at the end. Other in-class WODs did not require this as I attribute to my practicing of TA WODs and studying to be effective in being proficient at the real assessments.</p>

<h3 id="essays">Essays</h3>
<p>I did not use AI for my Essays in this course as the tasks were quite simple enough and I wanted my writings to be more personal and have my own style of writing. It is hard to cover all the details we are required to write about in essays using AI, therefore I can write about what I like, how I want it, while also improving my skills.</p>

<h3 id="final-project">Final project</h3>
<p>I have not used AI for the Final Project as it has not come up as necessary and I would like to put my own effort and thought into it. Being able to divide tasks amongst group members allows me to put more time into one task rather than worrying about the end goal too much. Using AI did not seem worth the effort in a group project where others are also working very hard at their own tasks.</p>

<h3 id="learning-a-concept--tutorial">Learning a concept / tutorial</h3>
<p>Usually, AI outputs a huge amount of information when you ask it about a concept or tutorial, so it feels too burdensome for me to read all of it. I would much rather watch a video in the background and learn that way. There are cases when AI could get the concept wrong or explain it incorrectly. This way, I can avoid that and type in a few keywords on YouTube and find what I am looking for.</p>

<h3 id="answering-a-question-in-class-or-in-discord">Answering a question in class or in Discord</h3>
<p>I have not had this use case come up once, so I did not use it. Answering a question in class gives you only a small window of opportunity to respond, therefore typing a question in an AI chatbot and reading it, then answering it to a professor or student will take way too much time.</p>

<h3 id="asking-or-answering-a-smart-question">Asking or answering a smart-question</h3>
<p>There was no circumstance where I had to use AI for this issue. I tend to look at Discord to see if someone has already asked a question similar to one I would ask and look for the answer that way. I am not the type of person who asks too many questions and tries to figure it out on my own. I know that there are many forums and tutorials on the topic already, so I can easily look for those.</p>

<h3 id="coding-example">Coding example</h3>
<p>I used something like this but without the underscore function, rather asking for an underscore function that can solve a problem. However, this did not yield great results as my question was most likely poorly worded and not specific enough.</p>

<h3 id="explaining-code">Explaining code</h3>
<p>I did not use AI for this as I wanted to use other resources for this. Explaining code is more of a personal thing to do. Sometimes, someone might have many follow up questions, therefore being able to explain it in simpler terms and more tailored answers, allows me to learn a little more while giving the other person a better understanding.</p>

<h3 id="writing-code">Writing code</h3>
<p>I have not had AI write code for me as the code I have seen output is not correct most of the time and makes me feel bad when using it. Usually, the code might not cover all aspects of the problem and miss out on certain features. Also, when the assignment requires you to use concepts that you have learned the current week but uses advanced topics that you have never heard about before, then it does not look too good and can get you marked down in grades.</p>

<h3 id="documenting-code">Documenting code</h3>
<p>I have not had to use AI to document code as that is too simple of a task to not do on my own. Documenting code is an interesting way to use AI as it can eliminate smaller tasks while focusing on others. However, documenting does not require too much time and should be done before you write your code most of the time.</p>

<h3 id="quality-assurance">Quality assurance</h3>
<p>This is an interesting use case and possibly something that I could use in the future if I am completely dumbfounded on my code. However, I have never used AI for this scenario. Typically, the IDE will point out errors in the code automatically, and sometimes it is easy enough to point out some mistakes in code like spelling or punctuation.</p>

<h3 id="other-uses-in-ics-314-not-listed">Other uses in ICS 314 not listed</h3>
<p>I think troubleshooting issues with apps such as IntelliJ IDEA or asking how to navigate using the command line can be interesting. I have not used AI in this case, but there are many situations I find myself in where server side processes do not succeed and I am just stuck and do not know what to do. I eventually just give up, but looking back at it, I could have asked AI to help me figure out a solution.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-learning-and-understanding">Impact on Learning and Understanding</h2>
<p>I feel like the impact of AI on learning and understanding can be detrimental to a studentâ€™s education. I have used AI for essays and forums for other classes and I tend to just pass it off and get a decent grade with minimal effort. Then I realize that I do not know much about the topics we learned and have no familiarity with certain terms. Therefore, it can be very easy for the AI to do all your work, while you just sit back and relax.</p>

<h2 id="practical-applications">Practical Applications</h2>
<p>I have used AI for classes other than ICS 314 and some of the responses were actually very good and believable. I ended up getting some good grades for those assignments that I used and therefore I would say it was effective. I think in terms of real-world applications, the issues could be way too difficult for the AI to write a complete solution. I think it would only be effective if you used it for small things like coding a button and fixing lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-and-opportunities">Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
<p>Some challenges are mainly math related. In my experience, AI can solve math problems quite well, however when it comes to very complex problems, or problems that have a lot of symbols that the AI or computer cannot input into the chatbox, it cannot solve it correctly. I had many issues where I could explicitly tell the AI what type of set I was using, but it would ignore it and treat it just normally. The difficulties of just using a chatbox could be the main issue and not the AI itself.</p>

<h2 id="future-considerations">Future Considerations</h2>
<p>What I like about AI is that educators are embracing AI, while also avoiding it. Some instructors are indifferent if their students are using AI for their assignments while also looking into how they can change their curriculum to avoid the need to use it as it can be seen as too basic of a task for students to put effort in. I think in some cases where there are more collaboration and group work, and opportunities to show the class your effort is where AI is forcing a change upon the educational system for the better. Hopefully in the future, we will not need to mindlessly submit an assignment and forget about it, but work on a project similar to how real-world jobs require and create something they can be proud of.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all, AI is a very interesting evolution in technology. There are now many use cases and it seems to be able to do tasks very well. It also pushes technology forward, especially past this stagnant phase in innovation. All devices are going to have to change and adapt and become more personalized for the user as other companies are doing the same. Schools will have to revise their curriculums in order to avoid students doing the minimum amount of work and getting good grades for it. Rather they must allow students to develop their skills and learn in new ways. Although I have not used AI in too many situations, I still find it very useful in many ways. AI is still developing and there will always be a long way to go before I can replace many old things in society, but I am interested in what those developers will do with AI and how it can help the greater good.</p>

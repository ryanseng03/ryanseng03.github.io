  <h3 id="smart-questions">SMART Questions</h3>

<p>Asking good questions is a skill. However it may not be a difficult one to hone. It may require a shift in thinking or mindset. Due to our generation growing up in this technological boom, we often take for granted that we can have so much information at the tip of our fingers, at any time. Maybe we are too accustomed to asking vague questions to our peers because we assume that they already know the context of the problem. Or maybe rely too much on others helping us on things when we can easily access that information on the web.</p>

<p>I have never been someone to ask for help if no one is around. I always try to figure out a way to solve the problem at hand, alone. There is always a search engine right in my hand. It is such a powerful tool. I can ask it to translate something for me, learn about programming functions, or even ask about the weather. This may stem from my reluctance to ask someone for help due to shyness or the belief that I do not need someone else’s assistance. Therefore, I just push through, and if I fail… I will take it.</p>

<p>Over the years however, I understand the importance of asking for help. I also know that I must ask for help when it is truly necessary and not just asking about general information. I do not expect everyone to know keyboard shortcuts nor why my graphics card drivers won’t install properly. There are people who work hard on product documentation. Things such as manuals or help pages that we often throw out, may eventually become useful after a few months, and online video tutorials are continuously being made for the general public to view and answer their questions. It is quite amazing that there are millions of people making a living by helping people with their software issues, or even their questions about life. People working hard on answering questions on discussion boards, and comments of videos. But how can we help them? Or even help them help us?</p>

<h2 id="asking-good-questions">Asking Good Questions</h2>
<p>StackOverflow is a community that allows users to ask questions about software and programming, then to receive help from other users waiting to answer them. I have been on the website multiple times. Usually just to see any homework solutions. I have never asked a question however. I never even commented on an online video! There are some good questions and they are awarded with multiple thoughtful and detailed answers. However, there are some pretty terrible questions such as “HELP ME WITH MY HOMEWORK” and then proceed to paste the body of their code into the prompt. The comments and replies are quite insane. Sometimes there are some passive aggressive comments, and sometimes there are straight, berating of the original poster. Although it may seem that the comments are by egotistical jerks, when you take their perspective into consideration, they have no idea how to help someone who does not describe the issue at hand in enough detail. The original poster must have some entitlement to assume that a community will read their mind, and give the answer straight away.</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9942594/unicodeencodeerror-ascii-codec-cant-encode-character-u-xa0-in-position-20">Unicode Encode Error<a></a></a></p>

<p>Here the original poster writes about having difficulty with unicode encoding errors. They detail what program they use and that the issue is produced only on some webpages. They provide two short snippets of their code and say what they have tried so far and what kind of errors they are getting. The answers are short and precise. The replies provide advice and documentation on the exact problem the original poster is having, and the comments are quite civil.</p>

<h2 id="some-bad-questions">Some Bad Questions</h2>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5886112/c-i-have-two-questions">C++ Homework Question<a></a></a></p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5767325/how-can-i-remove-a-specific-item-from-an-array-in-javascript">How to remove a specific item from an array<a></a></a></p>

<p>Here we have two different questions because I would like to cover both cases. The first one is about a C++ homework. It is a basic math program that calculates the sum of negative float numbers, and the sum of positive integers. It seems like a very easy task, and something that they probably would have learned in class. The replies are not surprising, such as asking the original poster what they have tried so far, or if they even did anything.</p>

<p>The second question is a very basic question that they could have just copy and pasted into a search bar. This is one of the most inefficient methods of asking for help as it can be found in a Javascript array documentation or just a quick video tutorial. Rather, the poster would rather wait a few hours to a few days in order to get someone to reply to them.</p>

<p>As we can see, asking good questions can give you very insightful answers. Asking poorly written questions can cause you to be humiliated.</p>

<h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>

<p>We can avoid this by assuming that the commenters do not know everything and try to lead them to have the same understanding of where you are at in the program. Not just copy and pasting your entire code into the website prompt, but detailing the problem, what have you tried so far such as alternatives or switching things around, what have you searched up on the web, and so on. This way the commenters will not have to ask too many further questions, or spend too much time figuring the problem out while the original poster just waits around. This will make everyone’s lives easier, and build a better community.</p>

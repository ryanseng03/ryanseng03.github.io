<h2 id="final-project">Final Project</h2>

<p>Our final class project engaged a team of five talented individuals to create a comprehensive website dedicated to reviewing academic courses across various disciplines. The endeavor was a fusion of collaborative effort, technical prowess, and an acute understanding of user experience.</p>

<p>The primary aim of our project was to design and develop a user-friendly platform that empowers students to share, explore, and assess different courses available in their educational institutions.</p>

<h3 id="objective-and-scope">Objective and Scope:</h3>

<p>The project aimed to address the following key objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Course Database: Create an extensive database of courses from diverse academic fields.</li>
  <li>User Reviews: Allow users to leave reviews, ratings, and comments about their experiences with specific courses.</li>
  <li>Search and Filter: Develop robust search and filter functionalities for users to easily navigate and find relevant course information.</li>
  <li>Responsive Design: Ensure the website is accessible and optimized for various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="project-approach">Project Approach:</h3>

<p>Our team adopted an agile methodology to manage tasks efficiently and promote iterative development. Regular meetings were held to discuss progress, address challenges, and brainstorm innovative solutions. Tasks were divided among team members based on individual strengths and expertise while maintaining constant communication to ensure seamless integration of different components.</p>

<p>The project underwent several stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Planning and Design: Extensive brainstorming sessions were conducted to outline the website’s structure, features, and user interface through wireframes and mockups.</li>
  <li>Development: Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript alongside backend frameworks like Django, the website’s core functionalities were implemented, including database management, user authentication, and review submission systems.</li>
  <li>Testing and Refinement: Rigorous testing was carried out to identify and rectify bugs, ensuring a smooth user experience. Feedback loops were instrumental in refining features and improving overall performance.</li>
  <li>Deployment: After thorough testing and refinements, the website was deployed to a hosting service, making it accessible to users.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="personal-effort">Personal Effort:</h3>
<p>For my share of effort, I created the review cards component, which would be used throughout the website. One main function of the review cards was to power the user reviews page. This page allows the logged-in user to render their own reviews and edit and delete if necessary.</p>

<h2 id="to-conclude">To Conclude</h2>

<p>In conclusion, the creation of this course review website was a collaborative effort that showcased our team’s dedication, technical skills, and ability to overcome challenges. The platform stands as a testament to our commitment to enhancing the educational experience by providing students with a reliable source for course evaluations and recommendations.</p>

<p>The project not only fulfilled its primary objectives but also instilled a sense of accomplishment and learning experience for each team member, solidifying our abilities in web development, teamwork, and problem-solving.</p>
